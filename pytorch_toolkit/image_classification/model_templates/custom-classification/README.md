# Image classification

Models that are able to classify images on CPU.

| Model Name | Complexity (GFLOPs) | Size (Mp) | Top-1 on ImageNet (%) | Links |
| ---        | ---                 | ---       | ---                   | ---                   |
| MobilenetV2 1.0 | 0.66           | 3.50      | 73.0                  | [model template](./mobilenet_v2_w1/template.yaml)

## Datasets

The model was initially trained on [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/), but can be trained from scratch or fine tuned to classify arbitrary images.

## Training pipeline

### 0. Change a directory in your terminal to action_recognition_2.

```bash
cd <training_extensions>/pytorch_toolkit/image_classification
```

### 1. Select a model template file and instantiate it in some directory.

```bash
export MODEL_TEMPLATE=`realpath ./model_templates/custom-classification/mobilenet_v2_w1/template.yaml`
export WORK_DIR=/tmp/my_model
python ../tools/instantiate_template.py ${MODEL_TEMPLATE} ${WORK_DIR} --do-not-load-snapshot
```

### 2. Prepare data

The training script assumes the data for classification is divided by folders in such a way when
each class has it's own folder. The script automatically computes number of subfolders in ine train
dataset directory and assumes each directory to represent one class. Indexes of classes are assigned
according to alphabetically sorted list of folders.

An example of the directory structure:

```
DATA_DIR
├── train
│   ├── Class1
|   |   └── <train images that belong to class 1>
│   ├── Class2
|   |   └── <train images that belong to class 2>
│   |── ....
│   └── ClassN
|       └── <train images that belong to class N>
│
└── val
    ├── Class1
    |   └── <val images that belong to class 1>
    ├── Class2
    |   └── <val images that belong to class 2>
    └── ....
    └── ClassN
        └── <val images that belong to class N>
```

After the data was arranged, export the variables required for launching training and evaluation scripts:

```bash
export TRAIN_ANN_FILE=''
export TRAIN_DATA_ROOT=${DATA_DIR}
export VAL_ANN_FILE=''
export VAL_DATA_ROOT=${DATA_DIR}
export TEST_ANN_FILE=''
export TEST_DATA_ROOT=${DATA_DIR}
export NUM_CLASSES=N
```
where `N` is the number of classes in the training dataset.

### 3. Change current directory to directory where the model template has been instantiated.

```bash
cd ${WORK_DIR}
```

### 4. Training and Fine-tuning

Try both following variants and select the best one:

* **Training from scratch** from scratch or pre-trained weights. Only if you have a lot of data, let's say tens of thousands or even more images. This variant assumes long training process starting from big values of learning rate and eventually decreasing it according to a training schedule.
* **Fine-tuning** from pre-trained weights. If the dataset is not big enough, then the model tends to overfit quickly, forgetting about the data that was used for pre-training and reducing the generalization ability of the final model. Hence, small starting learning rate and short training schedule are recommended.

```bash
python train.py \
   --train-ann-files ${TRAIN_ANN_FILE} \
   --train-data-roots ${TRAIN_DATA_ROOT} \
   --val-ann-files ${VAL_ANN_FILE} \
   --val-data-roots ${VAL_DATA_ROOT} \
   --save-checkpoints-to ${WORK_DIR}/outputs
```

> **NOTE**: It's recommended during fine-tuning to decrease the `--base-learning-rate` parameter compared with default value (see `${MODEL_TEMPLATE}`) to prevent from forgetting during the first iterations.

Also you can use parameters such as `--epochs`, `--batch-size`, `--gpu-num`, `--base-learning-rate`, otherwise default values will be loaded from `${MODEL_TEMPLATE}`.

### 5. Evaluation

Evaluation procedure allows us to get quality metrics values and complexity numbers such as number of parameters and FLOPs.

To compute mean accuracy metric run:

```bash
python eval.py \
   --load-weights ${WORK_DIR}/outputs/model/model.pth.tar-150 \
   --test-ann-files ${TEST_ANN_FILE} \
   --test-data-roots ${TEST_DATA_ROOT} \
   --save-metrics-to ${WORK_DIR}/metrics.yaml
```

### 6. Export PyTorch\* model to the OpenVINO™ format

To convert PyTorch\* model to the OpenVINO™ IR format run the `export.py` script:

```bash
python export.py \
   --load-weights ${WORK_DIR}/outputs/latest.pth \
   --save-model-to ${WORK_DIR}/export \
   --num-classes ${NUM_CLASSES}
```

This produces model `model.xml` and weights `model.bin` in single-precision floating-point format
(FP32). The obtained model expects **normalized image** in planar BGR format.
